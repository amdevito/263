Practicing voice responsive and annyang voice recognition.
Meets Brief:

- Added start page and end page - end page shows up after 6 answers correct
- counter using score Dots - 6 answers correct, you win, but if you get one wrong, one point is taken away. Points are circles that change colour depending if you gain or lose a point, or win.
- Anagrams instead of backwards animal names - you hear an anagram of the animals
- Additional: Get HINTS! - press 'A' shows the typed anagram, press 'L' for a random list (8) of animals with one that is the real answer.
- text changes color depending on if you gain or lose a point. Text goes bright yellow if you win.
- game tells you when you are correct or wrong.
- game tells you that you win and to refresh when you get 6 points.
