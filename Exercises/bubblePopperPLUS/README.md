# Bubble Popper PLUS

E4: Bubble Popper PLUS
Alana DeVito

Pop bubbles with your index finger as a pin or change to a hand tool and
bounce them around. Change tools by pinching index finger and thumb together for a quick second and then open hand again.

Brief:

- change colour when bubbles popped (gets more purple and then more green)

- popping sound when bubble popped.

- boing sound when bubble bounces

- start screen

- User pinches index and thumb together for a short moment, pin turns into hand and you can bounce bubbles downwards instead.
  Bounced bubble flashes greenish.
