// E6: Code-Taker Plus
///Generative soundscape prototype using JQUERY UI elements
// --- completing this exercise by developing some UI for my in progress project
// Brief:
// 1. X add modal instructions dialogue when the page loads. Explains to the user what the app is, what it does and how to interact with it.
// --- here, also choose between dark canvas or white canvas.
//2. X drag and drop modulating ripples on to the tone ripple canvas to add additional visual dynamics.
//3. X Hidden dialog box with options to change the scape's tone replay delay - 3 sec, 6, sec, 9 , or 12. and the option to change the size of the ripples in the canvas - smaller, bigger or back to normal.
//
// - (NEXT - after this exercise) the moveable ripples effects that tone that you place them on - for this exercise the movable ripples are just to customize the visual effect.
